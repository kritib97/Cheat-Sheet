# Cheat-Sheet
Includes all the Python scripts I have coded for projects so far.<br />
The 'Cheat Sheet for Data Modelling' consists of Functions, Algorithms and some Miscellaneous codes that might need to be used again in future data models.<br />
The 'Cheat Sheet for WOE & KS-Score' consists of the Python script for Weight of Evidence, Information Value and KS-Score using deciles of equal size that I couldn't find in any tech blog. <br />
Weight of Evidence gives the predictive power of independent variables in relation to dependent variable. Information value helps to rank variables based on importance.<br />
KS-Score gives a measure of how well a predictive model discriminates between events and non-events. A KS test compares the cumulative distribution of events and non-events and KS score is where there is maximum difference between them.
